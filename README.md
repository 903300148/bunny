# Bunny JS v 0.2
Lightweight native JavaScript and ECMAScript 6 library (package of small stand-alone components like routing, templating, ajax and datatables) and next generation front-end framework.

Designed in mind for best compatability for Laravel 5 and Bootstrap 4, however can be used anywhere.

Rollup.js with babel plugin is recommended for transpiling and bundling.
